## Introduction:
The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who apparently used it to communicate with his generals. The amount of 'shift' is called the **key** of the cipher.

## Example:
Here is a quick example of the encryption and decryption steps involved with the caesar cipher. The text we will encrypt is 'Programming is fun', with a shift (key) of 1.
